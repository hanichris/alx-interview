# Pascal's Triangle.

## Introduction
Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients that arise in
probability theory, combinatoics and algebra. The rows of the triangle are enumerated
starting with ```n=0``` at the top (O^th^ row). Entites are numbered from the left
beginning with ```k=0```.

The coefficients in Pascal's triangle are denoted as $$\dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \binom{n}{k}$$
