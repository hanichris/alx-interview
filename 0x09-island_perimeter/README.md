# Island Perimeter
## Description
Compute the perimeter of the island described in a ```grid```.
A gird, in this case, is a matix which is presented as a ```List[List[int]]```:
* A ``0`` represents water.
* A ``1`` represents land.
* Each cell is a square of unit length.
* The cells are connected horizonatally/vertically but not diagonally.
* The matrix is rectangular with the height and width not exceeding 100.
It should be noted that:
* The grid is completely surrounded by water.
* There is only one island (or nothing).
* The island does not contain any lakes.
